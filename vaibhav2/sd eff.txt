the code opens a journal 
if the open volume is of prev year the journal is rejected else we review remaining issues and crawl the open papers 

for each issue encountered the text is checked for the published date and if not new it is rejected too 

then the other closed journals are checked 

and there issues are checked in the same way 

for each page opened we scrape the papers published 


target is to get the urls of all the papers so that they can be passed on to selenium
